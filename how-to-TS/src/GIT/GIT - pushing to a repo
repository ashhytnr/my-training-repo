2. make your changes to one/many of the files
--- this is so you have something to commit

3. stage your files using [ git add . ]
--- this adds all (.) files to your commit

4. commit your changes once you're happy [ git commit -m "<message>" ]
--- e.g. git commit -m "changed whatever"

5. push your changes to the server [  git push origin <branch> ]
--- e.g. git push origin some-branch

6. go view your pull request either by using the first link given or [ gh browse ]

7. merge pull request on GitHub

8. back in the CLI, go back to main [ git checkout main ]
--- you should see your file revert back to what it looked like at the start of the previous commit
--- this is fine because you haven't updated your version with main yet
