git checkout - very versatile command

git log —oneline = lets you see the hash code so you can revert commits

git restore file_name = restores a file to it’s state at the previous most recent commit - you cannot undo this since changed were never commited

git restore —staged file_name = unstages files already in the staging area (using git add).

git reset then the hash also works to undo commits but ONLY commits. useful if you want to undo the commit but not the work

git revert - makes a new commit that matches the historical state of previous commit - better than git reset

git stash - temporarily shelves changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, you can come back to this.
git stash pop - pop changes out of stash
git stash apply - applies changes but leaves them in the stash

.gitignore:
Mypasswords.txt - ignores this specific file
directory_name/ ignores everything in this dir
*.sql - ignores everything ending with sql
