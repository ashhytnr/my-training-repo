1. make a project for the repo, set up where you want it to go etc.
useful commands: cd, ls, mkdir

2. run [ git status ]
--- this is to check you aren't already in a git repo
EXPECTED: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
--- this is good! It means your folder isn't already in a git repo

3. initialise the repo with [ git init ]
--- this creates a .git folder, marking the directory as a git repository (you won't see this in github)
EXPECTED: your terminal has git:(main)

4. stage files [ git add . ]
--- this gets your files ready for commit

5. commit files [ git commit -m "initial commit" ]
--- uh idk what to say about this yet

6. create a remote repo on github
--- just go to github and make a repo... yeah #loveTheGUI
--- NOTE: for some reason this only works with no readme

7. in the project, run [ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git ]
--- do this with the link provided in the repo when you made it
--- if you didn't get a link, you can copy the format above

8. run [ git remote -v ]
--- this verifies the remote connection

9. push files to main [ git push -u origin main ]
--- just for the start
